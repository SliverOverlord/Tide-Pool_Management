  Description:
    This program runs on an Arduino and is used to control water movement between two marine tanks replicating a natural tide pool.
    There are two valves controlled using servos to direct water to the desired destination. The pumps always run to prevent 
    pump failure. The Arduino reads two float sensors to control the range of water depth. The code will control the cycle time 
    to match a natural tide cycle as closely as possible.
